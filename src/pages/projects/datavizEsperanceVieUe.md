## I. Introduction

The project aims to design data visualizations for the web with animated support. The goal is to answer the question: "How to design relevant data visualizations that align with a communication objective?" The main steps include data selection, analysis, and processing, creating visual assets for the web, implementing animated supports, and creating responsive web pages with rich interactions.

## II. Data Selection, Analysis, and Processing

- Selection of data on life expectancy in the European Union and other relevant data such as GDP, HDI, and sanitation.
- Use of the World Bank's XML format for data structure and order.
- Use of a Python script to sort and format XML data.

## III. Definition and Creation of Visual Assets for the Web

- Reflection on suitable types of charts for the data, including maps, bar charts, and curves.
- Creation of a color palette with two main colors: pink and green.

## IV. Implementation of Animated Visualization Supports

- Creation of a Node.js API to convert XML data to JSON.
- Use of the Apache Echarts library to create charts, including a map of the European Union.
- Formatting, structuring, and sorting data in JavaScript for optimal use by Echarts.
- Configuration of data for dynamic charts.

## V. Production of Responsive Web Pages with Rich Interactions

- Management of universal animations between charts for smooth transitions.
- Use of React.js state variables to trigger chart updates when scrolling through the page.
- Addition of interactive animations, such as the disappearance of countries during interaction with a gradient.
- Responsiveness management with percentages and media queries in CSS.

## VI. Site Hosting

- Use of Vercel, a popular host for Next.js applications, to host the site.

## VII. Conclusion

The project covered data selection, processing, visual asset creation, animated support implementation, animation, interactivity, responsiveness, and hosting.
