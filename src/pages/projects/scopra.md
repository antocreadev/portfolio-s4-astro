description: "Scopra is a website created for the DataViz challenge, aiming to geolocate the main points of interest in Corsica. The site references monuments in Corsica based on the dataset from the opendata.corsica platform. To make the site more interactive, we developed a graphical interface that allows users to visualize different locations on an interactive map of Corsica, using the open-source Leaflet JS library. The project includes a sorting algorithm for the search bar and categories, a visual identity with photos, a logo, and a tagline, as well as a UI design implementation in CSS to enhance accessibility and understanding of the site."
