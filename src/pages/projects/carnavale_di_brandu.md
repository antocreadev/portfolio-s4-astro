# Carnavale di Brandu
The text discusses the creation of a graphic charter for the Carnaval de Brando, focusing on the poster, logotype, web and audiovisual elements, optimized photos, as well as goodies and merchandising.

## Poster
The poster highlights visual composition, featuring a catchy title and a layout that encourages top-to-bottom reading. The carnival's dark atmosphere is enhanced by the addition of smoke, and the A2 format was chosen for its international standard.

## Logotype
The monogram logotype incorporates textured letters with a wood pattern, creating a 3D effect to avoid a flat appearance. The Krungthep typography is used for its readability and impact.

## Web and Audiovisual Elements
Adaptations for social media include a banner and a logotype suitable for the square format. A "storie" is also created for social media, adjusting the text and characters.
