description: "We were tasked with creating an interactive poster on the subject of Paghjella. To achieve this, our first step was to create a 'print-type' poster in A2 format, which we would later make interactive.
Given the subject, we concluded that the objective of this S.A.E is to present a more modern image of Paghjella while preserving the essence of this chant. All of this is done by involving the user in the process, placing great importance on the user journey and interactivity."

This project aims to create an interactive poster about Paghjella, a Corsican chant. The goal is to modernize its perception while preserving its essence, focusing on the user experience.

The project begins with the creation of a minimalist visual with a dominant central element. Typography and color choices are carefully considered to reflect Paghjella.

Interactivity is introduced through a QR code leading to an interactive website. Various approaches are considered, including adding sounds and animations to guide the user and enhance their experience.

The project is published on GitHub for digital dissemination.

In conclusion, the project seeks to modernize Paghjella while respecting its heritage, prioritizing the user experience. Despite some time-related compromises, it is considered successful.
