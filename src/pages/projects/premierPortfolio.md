I have produced a website containing both static pages and pages generated from structured datasets, adhering to W3C standards and WCAG recommendations. This activity corresponds to the work of designing, integrating, and developing views of a web application in an agency. It involves combining resources related to development and integration, raising awareness among students about the need to adhere to development standards and best practices. It aims to make students independent at their workplace, for example, by encouraging them to host the produced site on a local server.
